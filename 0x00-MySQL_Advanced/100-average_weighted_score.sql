-- This SQL script creates a stored procedure named 'ComputeAverageWeightedScoreForUser' which takes in one parameter user_id.
-- It computes the average weighted score for a user by summing up the product of scores and weights of the user from the 'corrections' table, summing up the total weight, and then dividing the total weighted score by the total weight, and then updating the 'average_score' field of the user in the 'users' table.
